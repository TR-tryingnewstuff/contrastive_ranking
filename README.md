Test of Contrastive Ranking for Stock Picking


## Early Work :

The literature on asset pricing has attracted the attention of academicians and practicioners alike, particularly in the development and refinement of factors-based asset pricing models. These models have been instrumental in explaining the cross-section of expected stock returns and have contributed to the understanding of various anomalies in asset pricing. Notably, the development of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) by Markowitz (1952) laid the foundation of modern portfolio theories. According to the CAPM, the only factor that contributes to stocks’ expected returns is their betas, which represents an asset sensitivity to systematic risk, a risk component that cannot be diversified away.

If the model holds true, it must be that the inclusion of additional explanatory variables should not alter the results, and their estimated coefficients should be statistically indistinguishable from zero. In this regard, later worked showed that additional variables such as companies’ betas (Black, Scholes, and Jensen 1972), size, or book-to-market (Fama and MacBeth 1973) proved to be relevant predictors of stocks’ cross-section of returns. 

These findings attracted a lot of attention and many new factors have 

Empirical evidence has played a crucial role in shaping the discourse on asset pricing models. Studies have highlighted the positive relationship between average stock returns and profitability, investment, and other firm-specific variables. Additionally, the literature has explored the impact of macroeconomic variables on asset pricing, demonstrating the explanatory power of factors such as the growth rate of industrial production and consumption-wealth ratio. Furthermore, the existence of momentum returns over extended periods has been established, challenging traditional models and prompting the development of new asset pricing approaches.

Critiques of the CAPM have been prominent in the literature, with scholars questioning its ability to accurately predict stock returns and its reliance on linear relationships between assets' expected returns and market expected returns. The proliferation of asset pricing factors has led to the characterization of the landscape as a "zoo of factors," reflecting the diverse and numerous variables related to average stock returns. Moreover, the identification of anomalies in asset pricing has been a focal point, with anomalies arising when securities' realized returns deviate significantly from the returns predicted by asset pricing models.

In response to the limitations of traditional models, researchers have proposed new asset pricing models and factors, such as the Fama-French three-factors model and the inclusion of additional factors like momentum and quality. These developments have expanded the understanding of asset pricing and provided alternative frameworks for explaining stock returns.

Overall, the literature on asset pricing has evolved significantly, with a focus on refining existing models, identifying new factors, and addressing the limitations of traditional approaches. These advances have enriched the understanding of asset pricing and have paved the way for further research in the field.

The field of asset pricing has seen significant progress, with researchers investigating various factors and models to better understand stock returns and market behavior. Markowitz's work on portfolio selection in 1952 laid the foundation for modern portfolio theory, revolutionizing the approach to asset allocation and risk management (Markowitz, 1952). Subsequent research by Fama and French in 1992 introduced the size effect, which emphasized the influence of firm size on expected stock returns, challenging traditional views on asset pricing (Fama & French, 1992).

In 2015, Fama and French further expanded the asset pricing framework by proposing a five-factor model, which incorporated additional factors such as profitability and investment, providing a more comprehensive explanation for expected returns (Fama & French, 2015). This model addressed the limitations of the traditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and emphasized the significance of multiple factors in asset pricing.

The exploration of volatility and its relationship with expected returns has also been a focal point in asset pricing research. Ang et al. (2006) delved into the cross-section of volatility and expected returns, shedding light on the implications of volatility for asset pricing and market efficiency. Additionally, Moskowitz & Grinblatt (1999) examined the role of industries in explaining momentum, contributing to the understanding of market anomalies.

Furthermore, the consideration of idiosyncratic risk and its impact on expected stock returns has been a subject of interest. Fu (2009) explored the relationship between idiosyncratic risk and the cross-section of expected stock returns, providing insights into the role of risk in asset pricing. Goyal & Santa-Clara (2003) also re-evaluated the predictability of stock market returns with risk measures, contributing to the discourse on risk and return relationships in asset pricing.

The evolution of asset pricing models has also involved the examination of time-varying risk premia and the resurrection of the CAPM. Lettau & Ludvigson (2001) conducted a cross-sectional test of the (C)CAPM, considering time-varying risk premia and addressing the challenges faced by traditional asset pricing theories. Additionally, Yogo (2006) proposed a consumption-based explanation of expected stock returns, offering an alternative perspective on asset pricing based on consumption patterns.
